Good evening everybody.

I would like to keep my speech short
because I would like to go to the bathroom.

But as part of my research, 
I discovered that according to tradition,
the best man's speech should be as long 
as the groom's manhood.

■■■■

There comes a time in everyone's life 
when they meet their true love,
their soul mate / the person that is going to know 
and love them for the rest of their lives.

That moment came for Dominic, 12 years ago, when he met me.

To those who don't know, I am Norman.
Dominic and I met in college at UPLB.

Dominic was the Sandra Bullock of our batch - our Mister Congeniality.
He was the spark that started our group.
He is the link that kept us together after all those years.


But today, I am really happy that finally Dominic admitted that among our group,
I am actually is the best.. man.

Thank you Dominic for this title.

But in all seriousness, 
today Dominic is the true best man. 

And he is a man that I admire for many reasons.

Most notably his generous nature
He is the guy that will always provide the yellow paper during quizzes.

Dominic is also the most sociable guy I know,
a loyal friend and our dedicated driver.


I can still remember those days when we drove around in that beautiful blue car back in college.
Speaking of beautiful by the way, Karen, you look very stunning.




Dominic introduced Karen to us
he said that they have been together as a couple since June 2000.

Wow! 16 years and 7 months!

When Dominic announced that they will be married, 
I regret to say that a number of people expressed their concern / as to whether they were doing the right thing.

The general feeling was 
having only got together for 16 years and 7 months ago, 
they might just be rushing into things.

But to some including myself, we were actually surprised 
because we thought that they were already married years before.

Dominic and Karen are a testament to the famous quote from Blue, 
and I quote:

   "One love - for the city streets
    One love - for the hip-hop beats
    One love, Oh I do believe
    One love is all we need."

Dominic and Karen are a living example that love really conquers all!

Before I end my speech, 
on behalf of the wonderful couple, I would like to thank you for coming today.

I would also like to express my gratitude and thanks to the parents of Dominic and Karen, 
Mr and Mrs. de Leon, Mr and Mrs Amoloza,

Thank you for making this day possible.


So I would like to ask to all of you to join me in a toast to Dominic and Karen.

I would like to raise a massive toast 
to the two of the most beautiful,
wonderful, and loving people 
I've ever had the pleasure to have in my life.

To both of you who are starting out on a wonderful adventure today. 
Your marriage ahead of you will be filled with exciting possibilities 
and wonderful opportunities. 

It is with great pleasure 
that I say congratulations. 

And may you have many years of immense love and happiness.

We all wish you the best life that marriage has to offer. 

To Dominic and Karen, Congratulations!
Mabuhay and Kampai!
