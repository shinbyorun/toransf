Good evening everybody.
Anybody nervous?

I would like to keep my speech short, because I would like to go to the bathroom.

But as part of my research, I discovered that according to tradition,
the best man's speech should be as long the groom's manhood.

----

There comes a time in everyone's life when they meet their true love,
their soul mate, the person that is going to know and love them for the rest of their lives.
That moment came for Dominic, 12 years ago, when he met me.

To those who dont know, I am Norman.
Dominic and I met in college at UPLB.
Dominic was the Sandra Bullock of our batch - our Mister Congeniality.
He was the spark that started our group.
He is the link that kept us together after all those years.

But today, I am really really happy that finally Dominic admitted that among our group,
I am actually is the best.. man.

Than you Dominic for this title.

But in all seriousness, today Dominic is the true best man. 
And he is a man that I admire for many reasons.

Most notably his generous nature.
He is the guy that will always provide the yellow paper during quizes.

Dominic is also the most sociable guy i know,
a loyal friend and our dedicated driver.

I can still remember those days when we drove around in that beautiful blue car back in college.

Speaking of beautiful by the way, Karen, you look very stunning.

Dominic introduced Karen to us, he said they have been together as a couple since June 2000.

Wow! 16 years and 7 months!

When Dominic annouced that they will be married, I regret to say that a number of people
expressed their concern as to whether they were doing the right thing.

The general feeling was, having only got together for 16 years and 7 months ago, they might just be rushing into things.

But on the other hand, I was actually suprised because I thought that they were already married.

Dominic and Karen are a testament to the famous quote from Blue, and I quote:

"One love - for the mother's pride
 One love - for the times we cried
 One love - gotta stay alive
 Oh I will survice.
 One love - for the city streets
 One love - for the hip-hop beats
 One love, Oh i do believe
 One love is all we need."


Before I end my speech, on behalf of the wonderful couple, I would like to thank you for coming today.

I would also like to express my gratitude and thanks to the parents of Dominic and Karen, 
Mr and Mrs. de Leon, Mr and Mrs Amoloza,
for making this day possible.

Now I would like to request everyone to stand up and raise our glasses.
To congratulate the couple to a toast.
To ever happily ever after. Mabuhay. Kampai!
